        On the receipt, there is a website. Go there and click on 
        "Check Ballot." After you enter the serial number on the bottom of the 
        ballot you will see each race and the confirmation numbers that were 
        read for each. An announcement will be made on the website when the 
        numbers are available, but usually it is around 2 hours after the polls 
        close.

1. How do I mark the ballot? Use the pen provided to completely fill in the ovals indicating your choices.

2. What are the letters and numbers appearing under the ovals? These are privacy preserving confirmation numbers, and you should write them down on the privacy preserving receipt to check your vote online.

3. Can I tell how I voted with the confirmation numbers? No. The confirmation numbers only confirm that your marks were read properly from the ballot. No one can tell how you voted with the confirmation number only, and candidate names are never posted with matching confirmation numbers. 

The numbers do, however, allow third parties and the candidates running in the election to check the election results and perform audits. By checking the confirmation numbers and reporting any problems, you do your part to ensure that no votes were lost, modified, or counted improperly.

4. Can I use the pen to write down the confirmation number? Yes, if you write it on the detachable chit on the ballot. It will not write on regular paper. 

5. What happens if I make a mistake? Go back to the judge who assigned you to your poll booth. Your ballot will be marked as spoiled and you be given a new ballot.

6. How do I know the confirmation numbers printed properly on each ballot? Third parties and the candidates running the election can audit the printed ballots before and after the election, and if you spoil a ballot it is also audited to make sure that the confirmation numbers were printed correctly.

7. When and how do I check my confirmation numbers? On the receipt, there is a website. Go there and click on "Check Ballot." After you enter the serial number on the bottom of the ballot you will see each race and the confirmation numbers that were read for each. An announcement will be made on the website when the numbers are available, but usually it is around 2 hours after the polls close.

8. Am I required to check? No.

9. What if there's a problem with the confirmation number? If there is a discrepancy, double check to make sure that you might not have written the number down incorrectly. For example the numbers 0 and 1 and the letters O and l look very similar (only one of each is used in the election). If you see something completely different than what you wrote down, click on the link to report the problem. If you aren't sure, a link to a list of the letters and numbers used in the election is on the bottom of the page. In the real election, there will also be links to contact a candidate or a third party to report the problem. You do not have to identify yourself to report the problem, just tell them the confirmation number that should be listed.

10. Where do I go to get more information? There are many places. The first is the website listed on the receipt. You can also go to Takoma Park's website, or the Scantegrity website: http://scantegrity.org/
