Scanning ballot

Requires us to scan and determine the serial number. This tells us what the
ballot style is. 

Each ballot style has a set of contests on them with unique X/Y and height/width
coordinates for each contest. Each contest has a particular kind of contest
processor, which may be a 1D or 2D grid. 

Each election has a set of contests, each with their own ID.

Each ballot represents a specific ballot style, which has it's own ID, and
contains a subset of the election contests. 

Contest rules are dictated by the election. The Geometry is dictated by the
ballot style. 



Task order for scanner:

Read configuration for each ballot style: Create a map of Style ID number to a 
specific ballot style object.

Each style object has a Contest Reader for each contest and Geometric data 
inside.
