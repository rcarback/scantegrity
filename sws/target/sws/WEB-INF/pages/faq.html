        <li><a name="q1"><b>When do I check my confirmation numbers?</b>
        <p>An announcement will be made on the website when the 
        numbers are available, but usually it is around 2 hours after the polls 
        close.</p>
        
        </a></li>
        <li><a name="q2"><b>How do I mark the ballot?</b><p>
        Use the pen provided to completely fill in the ovals indicating your choices.
        </p></a></li>
        <li><a name="q3"><b>What are the letters and numbers appearing under the ovals?</b>
        <p>
        These are privacy preserving confirmation numbers, and you should write 
        them down on the privacy preserving receipt to check your vote online.
        </p></a></li>
        <li><a name="q4"><b>Can I tell how I voted with the confirmation numbers?</b><p>
        No. The confirmation numbers only confirm that your marks were read 
        properly from the ballot. No one can tell how you voted with the 
        confirmation number only, and candidate names are never posted with 
        matching confirmation numbers.</p><p>
        The numbers do, however, allow third parties and the candidates running 
        in the election to check the election results and perform audits. By 
        checking the confirmation numbers and reporting any problems, you do 
        your part to ensure that no votes were lost, modified, or counted 
        improperly.
        </p></a></li>
        <li><a name="q5"><b>Can I use the pen to write down the confirmation number?</b>
        <p>
        Yes, if you write it on the detachable receipt on the ballot. It will not 
        write on regular paper. 
        
        </p></a></li>
        <li><a name="q6"><b>What happens if I make a mistake? </b><p>
        Go back to the judge who assigned you to your poll booth. Your ballot
        will be marked as spoiled and you be given a new ballot.
        </p></a></li>
        <li><a name="q7"><b>How do I know the confirmation numbers printed properly on each ballot?</b><p>
        Third parties and the candidates running the election can audit the 
        printed ballots before and after the election, and if you spoil a ballot 
        it is also audited to make sure that the confirmation numbers were 
        printed correctly.
        </p></a></li>
        <li><a name="q8"><b>Am I required to check my confirmation number?</b><p>
        No. No one is ever required to check their confirmation numbers.
        </p></a></li>
        <li><a name="q9"><b>What if there's a problem with the confirmation number?</b><p>
        If there is a discrepancy, double check to make sure that you might not 
        have written the number down incorrectly. For example the numbers 0 and 
        1 and the letters O and l look very similar (only one of each is used in
        the election). If you see something completely different than what you 
        wrote down, click on the link to report the problem. If you aren't sure, 
        a link to a list of the letters and numbers used in the election is on 
        the bottom of the page.
        </p><p>
        In the real election, there will also be links 
        to contact a candidate or a third party to report the problem. You do 
        not have to identify yourself to report the problem, just tell them the 
        confirmation number that should be listed.
        </p></a></li>
        <li><a name="q10"><b>Will the ballots be recycled?</b><p>Absolutely yes. In 
        the real election the ballots, by law, must be kept a specified period of
        time. </p></a></li>
